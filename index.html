									<p>Perhaps one is more fortunate. Admirably proportioned, impressively refined? Then perhaps...one is a Bridgerton. A total of eight children in this most prolific of broods. The rather industrious viscountess and late viscount having produced four perfectly handsome sons and four perfectly beautiful daughters. Yes. Perfect, indeed. Unlike Lady Featherington, the widowed Lady Bridgerton shrewdly chose to allow just one of her daughters to make her debut this year. Her eldest miss, the season's forthcoming diamond -- Miss Daphne Bridgerton. This author is left to wonder whether Her Majesty might reconsider the high praise she once afforded Miss Bridgerton. For we all must know what the Queen despises more than anything: being wrong.
									</p>

									<p>The drawing room at Bridgerton House currently appears to be emptier than the muddled head of the Queen's dearest King George. Also, it has reached my ears that the betting books at White's propose the most fascinating of pairings this season. If one is trust these accounts, despite the fact they are all written by men, then Colin Bridgerton shall be awarded the year's grand prize when he sweeps Miss Thompson from her pretty little slippered feet. In other news, a most peculiar suitor for Miss Daphne Bridgerton has emerged. Though this miss cannot possibly believe that the town idiot will be able to reverse her rather dire circumstances, can she? It appears Miss Daphne Bridgerton has captured the interest of the newly returned Duke of Hastings. Perhaps she is the season's most precious gem -- incomparable and unbreakable -- after all. Of course how Miss Bridgerton secured her newfound suitor is yet to be determined.

								<p>Perhaps one resides within the household of a certain Lord Featherington. Should one have a bracket for a face? Three misses. Fosited upon the marriage market this season like sorrowful sows by their tasteless, tactless dear mama -- the luckless souls. Shall one Portia Featherington finally resist bedecking her misses in the most unflattering of colors? Or shall she have them appear as only the most undesirable pieces of overripe citrus fruit, once again? Of course, it follows that Lady Featherington is to receive what she has always desired. The season's true Incomparable, living under her own roof. She must be overjoyed.</p>
